I've had similar issues in the past and I think there may be a potential bug in cloning with git lfs (Still to be determined). You can try this method of fetching the repo, which is in fact faster too:

// Skip smudge - We'll download binary files later in a faster batch git lfs install --skip-smudge

// Do git clone here git clone ...

// Fetch all the binary files in the new clone git lfs pull

// Reinstate smudge git lfs install --force

This only needs to be done once to initialize the clone for the first time.

Please do test it and let me know if it fixes it.
