Servers MUST drop smaller packets that specify unsupported versions.,Learned Model
"   If a server receives a packet that indicates an unsupported version but is large enough to initiate a new connection for any one supported version, the server SHOULD send a Version Negotiation packet. Servers MAY limit the number of packets that it responds to with a Version Negotiation packet. Servers MUST drop smaller packets that specify unsupported versions. The first packet for an unsupported version can use different semantics and encodings for any version-specific field.  In particular, different packet protection keys might be used for different versions.  Servers that do not support a particular version are unlikely to be able to decrypt the payload of the packet. Servers SHOULD NOT attempt to decode or decrypt a packet from an unknown version, but instead send a Version Negotiation packet, provided that the packet is sufficiently long. Packets with a supported version, or no version field, are matched to a connection using the connection ID or - for packets with zero-length connection IDs - the local address and port.  If the packet doesn’t match an existing connection, the server continues below. If the packet is an Initial packet fully conforming with the specification, the server proceeds with the handshake (Section 7). This commits the server to the version that the client selected. If a server refuses to accept a new connection, it SHOULD send an Initial packet containing a CONNECTION_CLOSE frame with error code CONNECTION_REFUSED. If the packet is a 0-RTT packet, the server MAY buffer a limited number of these packets in anticipation of a late-arriving Initial packet.  Clients are not able to send Handshake packets prior to receiving a server response, so servers SHOULD ignore any such packets. Servers MUST drop incoming packets under all other circumstances.",Potentially Synthesised Model
