\begin{definition}
The learning problem is to take an instance of a QUIC implementation and be able to learn in black box a Mealy Machine from queries that provides an abstraction that is detailed and expressive enough to accurately verify relevant properties.

We define the Mealy Machine learned as a tuple $(S, S_0, \Sigma, \Lambda, T, G)$. 
Where S is the learned finite set of states. 
$S_0$ is the initial state such that $S_0 \in S$.
$T$ is the transition function $T \colon S \times \Sigma \to S$.
$G$ is the output function $G \colon S \times \Sigma \to \Lambda$.
$\Sigma$ is the input alphabet given to the learner to observe such that $\Sigma \subseteq L(P)$. 
$\Lambda$ is the output alphabet constructed by the learner from observing the outputs to respective input queries from $\Sigma$ such that $\Lambda \subseteq 2^{L(P)}$, as an input abstract symbol has a set of abstract symbols as its output.
